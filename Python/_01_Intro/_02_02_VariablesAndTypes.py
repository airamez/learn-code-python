# Variable
  # A computer is a special machine that operates by processing on data (information) and 
    variables are the basic structures to store data/information.
  # Each variable has: a name (identifier), a type and its content

# Type
  A computer stores any type of information in a binary mode, (like zeroes and ones), 
  that means it is necessary to associate the stored content to a type, so the computer
  can interpreter the data as expected.
  # Common types in Python:
    # Integer
    # Floating point
    # Boolean
    # String

# Identifier
  # An identifier is a name used to identify something in a program.
  # In Python an identifier is case sensitive, and starts with a letter, or
    an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores or digits (0 to 9)
  # PS: An identifier can't start with a number (This is valid for all languages I know)
  # Reserved words:
